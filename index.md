Hello! Iâ€™m a Software Engineer at [ONE](https://www.one.app/) working towards building a financial service to help people achieve financial progress by offering one app to save,spend,borrow and grow money.

I have dabbled into various paradigms of engineering from building mobile apps, cognitive computer vision solutions, building cloud native platform for banking services to building cloud database solutions. I have a strong interest in building large scale systems, which can help solve real world problem(s). Of lately, I have also been keen to explore the paradigms around **AI** and have dabbled my feet into building RAG applications.

I have also had the opportunity to work with engineering teams at **Microsoft**, **Marcus, Goldman Sachs**, **Samsung Research** and **TIFR** on various interesting projects post completing my undergrad at **BITS-Pilani**.

You can find more details on my work experience [here](./experience). And if they impress you here's my [resume](./resume.pdf).

Hello! Iâ€™m a Software Engineer at [Azure Data, Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/) working towards building a suite of tools and services to help customers modernise their data workloads to cloud to take a leap into the next normal of computing.

I have dabbled into various paradigms of engineering from building mobile apps, cognitive computer vision solutions, building cloud native platform for banking services to now building cloud database solutions. I have a strong interest in building large scale systems, which can help solve real world problem(s). Of lately, I have also been keen to explore the Web3 world and have tried to dip my feet into the **blockchain** world.

I have also had the opportunity to work with engineering teams at **Marcus, Goldman Sachs**, **Samsung Research** and **TIFR** on various interesting projects post completing my undergrad at **BITS-Pilani**.

You can find more details on my work experience [here](./experience). And if they impress you here's my [resume](./resume_ms_update.pdf).

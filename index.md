Hello! Iâ€™m a Final Year Computer Science Undergrad at [Birla Institute of Technology and Science Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani). I am keen to explore various paradigms in computer science and engineering and have currently developed my interest in Applied Machine Learning and Software Development.

I have a liking towards Deep Learning solutions which are helpful in the field of **Computer Vision** and **NLP**. Of late I have developed interest into **Reinforcement Learning** and how Deep Nets are being utilised in the field.

I have had the opportunity to work with **HBCSE,TIFR** and **Samsung Research Institute,Banglore** on some interesting projects in my summer recess.

You can find a list of some of my projects [here](./projects). And if they impress you here's my [resume](./resume.pdf).

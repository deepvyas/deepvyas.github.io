### **Engineering | Stripe, Bengaluru**

*Nov 2024 - present*

I work as a part of Document Databases Engine team under the Databases Core Infrastructure group at Stripe. Our org is the guardians and the team responsible to push the boundaries of [DocDB](https://stripe.com/blog/how-stripes-document-databases-supported-99.999-uptime-with-zero-downtime-data-migrations) one of the largest **MongoDB** fleets in the world. 

My primary work involves diving deep into novel issues that pop out of running MongoDB at scale and optimizing and tuning the engine for being able to serve 5M+ RPS of queries to the databases. It also involves thinking and strategizing about version currency and how we can run database upgrades across such a large fleet while maintaining **0 down time** and having no end-user facing incidents.

Along side that, I also lead the vertical scaling and efficiency improvements initiatives within the org focusing on bring down the cost per unit of storage and running the infrastructure in the leanest way possible while maitaining **99.99995%** of uptime of the platform.

I worked as a part of a team called VizInsight, which was responsible for building cognitive solutions based on computer vision which powered the AI based features on Camera, Gallery and Bixby for Samsung's flagship devices in the Galaxy and Note series.

My work involved building and training Deep Neural Models for large class Object Recognition (more than 1000 categories). The models had to be designed keeping in mind they are to be deployed on-device and made compatible with the Neural Process Unit embedded in the SoC.

I also helped develop several modules of the core on-device AI engine behind [Bixby Vision](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/vision/), which used the above models for inference and integrated with the Bixby framework for providing seamless experience to the end user.

### **Summer Intern | HBCSE, TIFR**

*May 2016 - July 2016*

I have worked in [Homi Bhabha Center for Science and Education, TIFR](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/) in the summer of 2016 under the guidance of [Prof Nagarjuna G.](https://gnowgi.org/), chairperson of _FSF,India_.

I was working in the project to add a data-analytics dashboard to **MetaStudio** a GNU project. Our task was to develop a visualisation dashboard to provide a sublime interface for the admin to visualize data being collected from schools across 4 states in the country along with a data-model to efficiently store and query this data.

I was involved in developing the visualization dashboard wherein we used D3.js to make a interactive interface to plot the data from the data model onto a country-map based on the geo-location attribute of the data.

The project is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnowledge/gstudio).

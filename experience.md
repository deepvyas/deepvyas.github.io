### **Software Engineering Analyst | Goldman Sachs, Bangalore**

*Jul 2019 - Present*

I work as a part of a team which started of building shared platform services for the [Apple Cards](https://www.goldmansachs.com/our-firm/history/moments/2019-apple-card.html) stack and has now been entrusted to build out commons services and engineering patterns for the goal of building a BaaS (Banking as a Service) offering under [Marcus](https://www.marcus.com/) bandwagon.

My work here involves building out shared services for the platform to handle common concerns like Authorization, sending out communications and maintaining customer profiles. 

We also build out core libraries to maintain a uniform patterns across layers like web security, cryptography, access to data stores(like Mongo, S3, RDS, DynamoDB), using messaging queues(like Kafka) and using Serverless Compute(like Lambdas).

We also manage large MongoDB deployments on cloud in association with [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud), and are working on building a *change-data-capture* platform to help with ingesting changes on our data stores to our DataLake for satifying governance and compliance regulations.

### **Software Engineer (Research) | Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore**

*Jun 2018 - Jul 2019*

I worked as a part of a team called VizInsight, which was responsible for building cognitive solutions based on computer vision which powered the AI based features on Camera, Gallery and Bixby for Samsung's flagship devices in the Galaxy and Note series.

My work involved building and training Deep Neural Models for large class Object Recognition (more than 1000 categories). The models had to be designed keeping in mind they are to be deployed on-device and made compatible with the Neural Process Unit embedded in the SoC.

I also helped develop several modules of the core on-device AI engine behind [Bixby Vision](https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/apps/bixby/vision/), which used the above models for inference and integrated with the Bixby framework for providing seamless experience to the end user.

### **Summer Intern | HBCSE, TIFR**

*May 2016 - July 2016*

I have worked in [Homi Bhabha Center for Science and Education, TIFR](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/) in the summer of 2016 under the guidance of [Prof Nagarjuna G.](https://gnowgi.org/), chairperson of _FSF,India_.

I was working in the project to add a data-analytics dashboard to **MetaStudio** a GNU project. Our task was to develop a visualisation dashboard to provide a sublime interface for the admin to visualize data being collected from schools across 4 states in the country along with a data-model to efficiently store and query this data.

I was involved in developing the visualization dashboard wherein we used D3.js to make a interactive interface to plot the data from the data model onto a country-map based on the geo-location attribute of the data.

The project is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnowledge/gstudio).

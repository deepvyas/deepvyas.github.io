### **Prevention of DNS Cache Poisoning Attack | Mentor: Dr. Vishal Gupta**

*August 2017 - December 2017*

Worked under the guidance of [Dr. Vishal Gupta](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/vishalgupta/profile) in exploring various methods to prevent _DNS Cache Poisoning Attacks_ and figuring out an implementation in _Software Defined Network_(**SDN**) environment.

We explored various methods of cache poisoning attacks and their prevention methods and tried to figure a solution to prevent them in _SDN_ environment. Although _DNSSEC_ is a fullproof solution to cache-poisoning but its complete adaption is yet to take some time.

We developed and implemented a solution based on idea described in a paper [Delay Fast Packets](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f627/636d3b90840b5678cdde4702158f4a534b59.pdf). The solution was written in _FloodLight_ a SDN Controller and tested on a testbed written in _MiniNet_.

### **Extractive Text Summarization | Mentor: Dr. Yashwardhan Sharma**

*August 2017 - December 2017*

Worked under the guidance of [Dr. Yashwardhan Sharma](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/yash/profile) in [WiSoC](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/PILANI/COMPUTERSCIENCE/WebIntelligenceandSocialComputingLab) Lab to conduct studies in the field of automatic text summarization especially techniques used in the domain of Neural Networks.

We developed a prototype system based on CNNs for the task of summarizing texts of Indian Languages as a part of this project and also a para-phrase detection system for training data generation due to lack of enough corpus on Indian Languages like Hindi,Bengali,Marathi and Telugu.

I also developed a small tool for scraping and transliterating various tweets and prodct reviews for an on- going sentiment analysis project in the lab.

### **Backend Platform | Legistify**

*Feb 2015 - December 2015*

Worked with [Legistify](https://www.legistify.com/corporate/) which is a startup from BITS-Pilani as one of the initial members of the team to setup the MVP for the legal platform.

We developed the MVP and core feature of automated legal document generation to develop a one stop, hassle-free place for all major legal documents and agreement types generated and delivered by just providing the basic information needed.

Also developed the first version of a Q&A style platform which helped people post their common legal queries and get answers from registered lawyers on the platform.

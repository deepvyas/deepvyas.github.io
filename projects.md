### **Software Engineering Intern | Microsoft IDC, Hyderabad**

*Jan 2018 - Present*

I am working as an intern in [Microsoft Kaizala](https://products.office.com/en-in/business/microsoft-kaizala) as a part of _Kaizala Actions Team_.

The work in this team involves developing Custom Actions for Kaizala and also features for the Action Design Platform. I am involved in developing a few game based Custom Actions and also in development of new features for Action Design Platform.

The work here has mainly given me exposure to work in a cross-platform application with most of my own work focused on the Android Platform with cross-code integration to JavaScript.

### **Software Engineering Intern | Samsung Research Institute, Bangalore**

*June 2017 - July 2017*

I worked as a summer intern in [SRI-B](http://www.samsung.com/in/aboutsamsung/samsungelectronics/india/rnd/) as
part of the _Web Services Team_.

My work was to develop a statistical model for ranking objects in _My Galaxy_ service to improve user experience. A Node.js based web-service was developed to achieve the same.

This work was planned for release in October 2017 and you might be using interacting with it unkowingly if you use My Galaxy on any of your Samsung devices.

### **Summer Intern | HBCSE, TIFR**

*May 2016 - July 2016*

I have worked in [Homi Bhabha Center for Science and Education, TIFR](http://www.hbcse.tifr.res.in/) in the summer of 2016 under the guidance of [Prof Nagarjuna G.](https://gnowgi.org/), chairperson of _FSF,India_.

I was working in the project to add a data-analytics dashboard to **MetaStudio** a GNU project. Our task was to develop a visualisation dashboard to provide a sublime interface for the admin to visualize data being collected from schools across 4 states in the country along with a data-model to efficiently store and query this data.

I was involved in developing the visualization dashboard wherein we used D3.js to make a interactive interface to plot the data from the data model onto a country-map based on the geo-location attribute of the data.

The project is open source and can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/gnowledge/gstudio).

### **Backend Development Intern | Legistify**

*February 2015 - December 2015*

[Legistify](https://www.legistify.com/) is a startup by a BITS-Pilani Alumini.It the country's first online legal docuemnt maker.

I was involved in the founding team and worked as a backend developer for the initial setup of the website.

I was also involved in the work on developing an _automated document making platform_ the first of its kind in the country. I was also involved in developing a _Question and Answer_  forum as a part of the Legal Research initiative.

### **Prevention of DNS Cache Poisoning Attack | Mentor: Dr. Vishal Gupta**

*August 2017 - December 2017*

We worked under the guidance of [Dr. Vishal Gupta](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/vishalgupta/profile) in exploring various methods to prevent _DNS Cache Poisoning Attacks_ and figuring out an implementation in _Software Defined Network_(**SDN**) environment.

We explored various methods of cache poisoning attacks and their prevention methods and tried to figure a solution to prevent them in _SDN_ environment. Although _DNSSEC_ is a fullproof solution to cache-poisoning but its complete adaption is yet to take some time.

We developed and implemented a solution based on idea described in a paper [Delay Fast Packets](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/f627/636d3b90840b5678cdde4702158f4a534b59.pdf). The solution was written in _FloodLight_ a SDN Controller and tested on a testbed written in _MiniNet_.

### **Extractive Text Summarisation | Mentor : Dr. Yashvardhan Sharma**

*January 2017 - May 2017*

Under the guidance of [Dr.Yashvardhan Sharma](http://universe.bits-pilani.ac.in/pilani/yash/profile) I worked on developing a method for **Abstractive Text Summarisation**. The main objective of the project was to summarise text for _Indian languages_.

A solution based on Convolutional Neural Network was developed. The main hinderance in the project, which also paves way for its future scope is to collect data for various Indian languages, enough so that a semi-deep network could be trained.

Also most of the Gold standard datasets are for Abstractive Summarisation and hence a paraphrasing system was developed and attached as a precusor network to the main net for generating annotation during training phase.
